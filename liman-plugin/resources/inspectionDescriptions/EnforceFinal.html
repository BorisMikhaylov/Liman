<p> The
<pre><code>
        @ForceFinal
    </code></pre>
annotation is a custom Java annotation used to enforce the final modifier on various Java elements, including methods,
fields, and other code constructs. This annotation helps ensure immutability and thread-safety by preventing accidental
modifications to these elements once they have been declared as final.
<p>
    The first sentence must be in a dedicated paragraph separated from the rest of the text. This will make the
    description easier to read.
    Make sure the description doesnâ€™t just repeat the inspection title.
